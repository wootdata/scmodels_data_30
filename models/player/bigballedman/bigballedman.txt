  He's big, he's balled, we presume he's a man, therefor... he is 
BigBALLedMan.  This is the first version of BigBALLedMan so there may
be errors in the design.  If you find any errors please email us.

INSTALLATION:

After unzipping the three files (BigBALLedMan.mdl, BigBALLedMan.txt, 
and BigBALLedMan.bmp) place them into a folder named "BigBALLedMan" 
exactly like that.  Then place that folder into the 
"Sierra\Half-life\valve\models\player\".  If you do not have that 
folder than place the "BigBALLedMan" folder were ever your other 
models are.
